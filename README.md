# 🏗️ Brownfields Projects Repository

Welcome to the **Brownfields** repository—a collection of projects focused on updating, refactoring, or modernizing legacy codebases.
Each subproject in this repository represents a real-world brownfield scenario where legacy code is reviewed, updated, and brought up to modern standards.

## 📌 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:

- Provide examples of legacy code modernization.
- Document strategies for refactoring, upgrading, or migrating old systems.
- Showcase before-and-after code states for learning and reference.
- Serve as a portfolio of brownfield development work.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each subdirectory in this repo represents a standalone project. Inside each project folder, you'll find:

- `README.md` – Project-specific overview and instructions.
- `legacy/` – The original legacy code (as-is).
- `updated/` – The refactored or modernized version of the code.
- Additional files or notes as needed for each specific case.

Example structure:

```

brownfields/
│
├── project-legacy-auth/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── legacy/
│   └── updated/

├── project-xml-parser/
│   ├── README.md
