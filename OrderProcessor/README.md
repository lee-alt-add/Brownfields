OrderProcessor

*Refactoring Tasks:*

1. *Extract methods*: Break down the `processOrder` method into smaller, more manageable methods.
2. *Use enums*: Replace the string-based payment method with an enum.
3. *Use a payment processor interface*: Introduce an interface for payment processing to make the code more extensible.
4. *Improve code organization*: Organize the code into separate classes or packages to improve maintainability.
5. *Add unit tests*: Write unit tests to ensure the refactored code works as expected.

Your task is to refactor this legacy code to make it more maintainable, efficient, and scalable. Good luck!
